Spark Tutorial
=============

This represents the beginning of a tutorial I was creating for Spark users on 
the Gordon supercomputer at the San Diego Supercomputer Center.  I ran out of 
time when building out the full set of training material, but this is what I 
thought might be useful and worth keeping for posterity.

The wordcount-spark example looks for an input file called "gutenberg.txt"
which can be found on Gordon in /oasis/scratch/glock/temp_project/ucsdext2014.
